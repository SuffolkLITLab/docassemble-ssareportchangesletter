    SSA Report Changes
  description: |
    If you get SSI or SSDI (or both), you are required to tell Social Security about changes in your life by the 10th day of the month after the change happened. Failure to do so could result in an overpayment. If this change occurred in the past, you may wish to speak with a legal representative. 

    This tool helps you report changes to Social Security, including:

    * Update to personal information including phone number, address 
    * Change in living arrangements
    * Leaving the United States for more than 30 days in a row
    * Receipt of arrrest warrant. 
    * Changes to your employment status, if you start or stop work, or if there is a change in pay or hours worked
    * Changes to your resources including account balances or any money received
    * Change in marital status
    * School attendence if under age 22
    * Change in citizenship or lawful noncitizen status 
    
    If you are a person with a disability, you must also report 
    * Improvement in medical condition
    * Any change in your Ticket to Work status 
    * Any change in your work or Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) expenses
    


    Report these changes promptly and no later than the tenth day of the month after they happen to       get an accurate payment of benefits.

  can_I_use_this_form: |
    You can use this form if you are on SSI or SSDI and need to report changes to Social Security.
  before_you_start: |
    Before you start, you need to know: 
    1. Are you on SSI (Supplemental Security Income), SSDI (Social Security Disability), or both?
    2. If you are working and getting paid, you need the name and address of the place you work, the      number of hours you work, and how much you are paid. Your pay stubs should have all this              information on them, so having them with you from the start will be helpful. 
    3. If you are answering questions for someone else, you need their full name, address, and Social     Security number.

    Make sure you have specific information, like dates and addresses, before you start. This will        help you complete the form more quickly.

new_changes
  This is a tool for people on SSI or SSDI disability benefits. It will help you write
  a letter to the Social Security Administration (Social Security) or document  
  [important changes](https://blog.ssa.gov/reporting-changes-is-your-responsibility/) 
  in your life they need to know about. 
  You may report some changes directly the SSA by visiting [here] (https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)

  If you get SSI or SSDI (or both), you are required to tell Social Security about changes in 
  your life by the 10th day of the month after the change happened. Failure to do so could 
  result in an overpayment. If this change occurred in the past, you may wish to speak with a 
  legal representative. 
  
  Updates may include updates to personal information, changes in living arrangements, 
  changes in employment, changes to resources, changes in marital status, living outside the 
  United States for more than 30 days in a row, changes in citizenship or lawful noncitizen 
  status. 

  If you are a person with a disability, you may need to also report improvements in your 
  medical condition, any changes in your 'Ticket to Work' status, or any changes in your work 
  or PASS expenses.
